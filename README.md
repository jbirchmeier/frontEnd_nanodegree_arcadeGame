Welcome to my game!

The goal of the game is to move your character across the screen successfully without running in to any of those pesky bugs. 

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move in any direction on the screen. Once you reach the water, you win! If you run in to a bug, the game will restart. 

Have fun!
